1. User History, User Cancel Booking.    -- It is ok
2. Room Deadline Day : we need not list rooms if it is not valid in Day.  -- It is Ok.

3. Introduction

2014-11-25 : 
1. Admin can list all rooms booking by user
   So we should pass userid as the parameters!

2. User Profile Manage: change password, change name.

3. Send random password to user's email

----------------------
Conclusion:

1. Should First Do Big Picture Template:
   For Instance:
     Normal User -> default layout (with left nav menu)
     Admin  user -> default layout (with a defferent nav menu)
  these big one can avoid a lot of code.

2. make more common widget, and make every part as modular as possible.
   
3. make reusable means make MORE mudolau WIDGET!
   For example : list user booking records, we can make it a widget.
